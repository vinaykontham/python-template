## API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Root endpoint to check if the service is running
- `GET /secure-data` - Secure OAuth-protected endpoint

## Deployment Options
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **Kubernetes** (Manifests can be added as needed)
- **CI/CD Integration** with GitHub Actions

## Customization
Modify `routes.py`, `models.py`, and `auth.py` based on your project requirements.
```

Now, the template includes **OAuth2 authentication and a CI/CD pipeline setup**! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any additional features!
